# Welcome to FridgeBuddy, your sustainable pantry companion!

Fridgebuddy allows you to track the food you buy from the moment you add it to your shopping list. 

Using FridgeBuddy, you can create an account and access all your foods' info on your phone, laptop, or any browser-connected device. Simply log in, add foods to your shopping list, and check them off as you buy them. FridgeBuddy will automatically send any bought foods to a "Fridge List" where you can edit and track the expiration dates of each item in your fridge, pantry, or freezer.
